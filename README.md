# Web Scraping API for AI Agents

## Project Overview

**Idea:** A full-stack application that scrapes data from user-provided URLs and analyzes and categorizes the data using a lightweight AI model. The project will include a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment, along with logging and monitoring for real-time performance tracking.

This project aligns with Olostep's goal of programmatically accessing and interacting with the Web at scale, with added AI integration for data analysis, crucial for AI Agents.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI Model:** TensorFlow.js or a pre-trained model for NLP
- **Automation:** CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Preferred Tools for Scraping:** Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer

## Architecture

- **User Interface:** 
  - A basic form to input URLs and trigger data scraping.
- **Backend:** 
  - Node.js server using Express.js to handle HTTP requests.
  - Web scraping implemented with Playwright or Puppeteer.
- **Database:** 
  - MongoDB for storing and managing scraped data.
- **AI Integration:** 
  - TensorFlow.js for categorizing and analyzing scraped data in real-time.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** 
  - Automated deployment using GitHub Actions.
  - Logging and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB instance running.
- Access to Olostep API.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-api.git
   cd web-scraping-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   OLSTEP_API_KEY=olostep_headstarter_api_Cco42mZirSwlh7OZJ5Cewe28HEk3q
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the web scraping API.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions:** Automated deployment setup to deploy code changes seamlessly.
- **Logging:** Integrated logging with Prometheus for performance tracking.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time performance monitoring using Grafana.
